Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
Overall, investing in the surf and ice cream shop seems promising with warm weather all year long.  With more consistent weather in June, sales will likely spike in this month vs. December.  In December, business will likely dial-back but that might be a good time to increase marketing efforts.  With visitors looking to hide from the winter time and travel, this is a good opportunity to attract these new customers. 

Two Additional queries that I performed was finding the precipitation for both June and December.  It was helpful to execute these queries to provide additional information to the analysis.  Along with that, I provided a plot chart to show the temperate observations.
